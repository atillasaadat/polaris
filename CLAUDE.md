# Ruflo — Claude Code Configuration

## Rules

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary — prefer editing existing files
- NEVER create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER save working files or tests to root — use `/src`, `/tests`, `/docs`, `/config`, `/scripts`
- ALWAYS read a file before editing it
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- NEVER add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer to user commits unless this project's `.claude/settings.json` has `attribution.commit` set (#2078). The Claude Code Bash tool may suggest one in its default commit-message template — ignore it. `Co-Authored-By` is semantic authorship attribution under git/GitHub convention; the tool is the facilitator, not a co-author.
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Validate input at system boundaries
- External reference data (EOP, TLEs, space weather, gravity/EGM, SPICE/JPL kernels, IGRF, leap seconds, …) is committed **verbatim in its original upstream format** and parsed as-is — never pre-processed into a bespoke intermediate as the committed artifact. Fetch tools auto-download from the authoritative source (record its URL); any trimming/derivation is computed *from* the committed original, not substituted for it. See design doc §3.7. Note the >500-line rule does not apply to these verbatim data files.
- ALWAYS keep documentation in sync with every change. When you make a change, before considering it done, update **all** relevant documentation, code comments, and — when the branch has an open PR — the PR **title and description** so they match what the code now does. This includes the design doc (`docs/design/Polaris_Design_Document.md`), header/inline comments, `CLAUDE.md` files, config comments, and any README/guide the change touches. Stale docs/comments/PR text are treated as a defect, not an afterthought.

## Agent Comms (SendMessage-First Coordination)

Named agents coordinate via `SendMessage`, not polling or shared state.

```
Lead (you) ←→ architect ←→ developer ←→ tester ←→ reviewer
              (named agents message each other directly)
```

### Spawning a Coordinated Team

```javascript
// ALL agents in ONE message, each knows WHO to message next
Agent({ prompt: "Research the codebase. SendMessage findings to 'architect'.",
  subagent_type: "researcher", name: "researcher", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ prompt: "Wait for 'researcher'. Design solution. SendMessage to 'coder'.",
  subagent_type: "system-architect", name: "architect", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ prompt: "Wait for 'architect'. Implement it. SendMessage to 'tester'.",
  subagent_type: "coder", name: "coder", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ prompt: "Wait for 'coder'. Write tests. SendMessage results to 'reviewer'.",
  subagent_type: "tester", name: "tester", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ prompt: "Wait for 'tester'. Review code quality and security.",
  subagent_type: "reviewer", name: "reviewer", run_in_background: true })

// Kick off the pipeline
SendMessage({ to: "researcher", summary: "Start", message: "[task context]" })
```

### Patterns

| Pattern | Flow | Use When |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Pipeline** | A → B → C → D | Sequential dependencies (feature dev) |
| **Fan-out** | Lead → A, B, C → Lead | Independent parallel work (research) |
| **Supervisor** | Lead ↔ workers | Ongoing coordination (complex refactor) |

### Rules

- ALWAYS name agents — `name: "role"` makes them addressable
- ALWAYS include comms instructions in prompts — who to message, what to send
- Spawn ALL agents in ONE message with `run_in_background: true`
- After spawning: STOP, tell user what's running, wait for results
- NEVER poll status — agents message back or complete automatically

## Swarm & Routing

### Config
- **Topology**: hierarchical-mesh (anti-drift)
- **Max Agents**: 15
- **Memory**: hybrid
- **HNSW**: Enabled
- **Neural**: Enabled

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy specialized
```

### Agent Routing

| Task | Agents | Topology |
|------|--------|----------|
| Bug Fix | researcher, coder, tester | hierarchical |
| Feature | architect, coder, tester, reviewer | hierarchical |
| Refactor | architect, coder, reviewer | hierarchical |
| Performance | perf-engineer, coder | hierarchical |
| Security | security-architect, auditor | hierarchical |

### When to Swarm
- **YES**: 3+ files, new features, cross-module refactoring, API changes, security, performance
- **NO**: single file edits, 1-2 line fixes, docs updates, config changes, questions

### 3-Tier Model Routing

| Tier | Handler | Use Cases |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Agent Booster (WASM) | Simple transforms — skip LLM, use Edit directly |
| 2 | Haiku | Simple tasks, low complexity |
| 3 | Sonnet/Opus | Architecture, security, complex reasoning |

## Memory & Learning

### Before Any Task
```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest memory search --query "[task keywords]" --namespace patterns
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks route --task "[task description]"
```

### After Success
```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest memory store --namespace patterns --key "[name]" --value "[what worked]"
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks post-task --task-id "[id]" --success true --store-results true
```

### MCP Tools (use `ToolSearch("keyword")` to discover)

| Category | Key Tools |
|----------|-----------|
| **Memory** | `memory_store`, `memory_search`, `memory_search_unified` |
| **Bridge** | `memory_import_claude`, `memory_bridge_status` |
| **Swarm** | `swarm_init`, `swarm_status`, `swarm_health` |
| **Agents** | `agent_spawn`, `agent_list`, `agent_status` |
| **Hooks** | `hooks_route`, `hooks_post-task`, `hooks_worker-dispatch` |
| **Security** | `aidefence_scan`, `aidefence_is_safe`, `aidefence_has_pii` |
| **Hive-Mind** | `hive-mind_init`, `hive-mind_consensus`, `hive-mind_spawn` |

### Background Workers

| Worker | When |
|--------|------|
| `audit` | After security changes |
| `optimize` | After performance work |
| `testgaps` | After adding features |
| `map` | Every 5+ file changes |
| `document` | After API changes |

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks worker dispatch --trigger audit
```

## Agents

**Polaris-specific** (`.claude/agents/`, prefer these — they carry the conventions):
`gnc-algorithms` (estimation/guidance/control math), `sim-environment` (truth plant,
environment, sensor/actuator models), `fsw-fprime` (F´ components, ports, topology),
`test-vv` (tests, golden fixtures, MC/traceability evidence), `fsw-code-reviewer`
(read-only audit of `flight/`+`lib/` against the flight standard), `docs-scribe`
(Doxygen/numpydoc, `refs.bib`, the Sphinx build).

**Generic fallbacks**: `coder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `planner`, `researcher`,
`system-architect`, `security-auditor`, `performance-engineer`, and the
`hierarchical-`/`mesh-`/`adaptive-coordinator` roles. Any string works as a custom type.

## Build & Test

- ALWAYS run tests after code changes
- ALWAYS verify build succeeds before committing

This is a C++/CMake/F´ + Python repo — there is no `npm`. Dependencies come from `uv`.

```bash
uv run fprime-util build                      # F´ core + PolarisFsw deployment
uv run cmake --build build-fprime-automatic-native-ut \
    --target polaris_unit_tests polaris_integration_tests polaris_golden_tests -j4
./build-fprime-automatic-native-ut/bin/Linux/polaris_unit_tests          # and the other two
uv run --group analysis pytest                # Python tooling + analysis suite
uv run --only-group docs bash tools/dev/build_docs.sh    # docs gate (warnings are errors)
uv run --only-group dev pre-commit run --all-files       # lint (git-add first)
```

`PROGRESS.md` § "Build & verify locally" carries the full recipe, including the
`configc` → `PrmDb.dat` → `-P` tuning path a SITL run needs.

## CLI Quick Reference

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest init --wizard           # Setup
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest swarm init --v3-mode     # Start swarm
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest memory search --query "" # Vector search
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks route --task ""    # Route to agent
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest doctor --fix             # Diagnostics
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest security scan            # Security scan
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest performance benchmark    # Benchmarks
```

26 commands, 140+ subcommands. Use `--help` on any command for details.

## Setup

```bash
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y ruflo@latest mcp start
npx ruflo@latest doctor --fix
```

> The background `daemon` is optional. It runs interval workers that each spawn
> a headless `claude` session, so it consumes tokens continuously. Start it only
> if you want those sweeps: `npx ruflo@latest daemon start` (self-stops after 12h
> by default; `--ttl 0` to disable, `daemon status --all` to audit running daemons).

**Agent tool** handles execution (agents, files, code, git). **MCP tools** handle coordination (swarm, memory, hooks). **CLI** is the same via Bash.
